* v3.4.0    2020-07-20

- Remove the token setup wizard because (a) it only ever supported
  Github, (b) Github is about to remove support for that on their
  end, (c) it did not always work, and (d) when it couldn't be used,
  or failed, then it made things /more/ complicated.  #113

- Various minor fixes and improvements.

* v3.3.0    2020-01-19

- Add a kludge to work around a bug in Emacs versions before 26.3 that
  often but not always causes network connections to fail when using
  TLS1.3.  On macOS use the workaround regardless of the Emacs version
  because the supposed bug fix does not appear to work there.  Add a
  variable ~ghub-use-workaround-for-emacs-bug~ to allow users to opt in
  or out of using the kludge.  #81

- Add a new library ~gsexp.el~ to encode S-expressions as GraphQl
  documents.  Previously we used the third-party library ~graphql.el~
  but using our own library gives us more flexibility.  Currently it
  is rather incomplete and only intended for use by ~ghub-graphql~ but
  I might fill the gaps and add documentation eventually.  I am not
  in a hurry though.  #90

- No longer depend on ~dash~.

- Handle some undocumented Bitbucket behavior. #97

- Add new option ~ghub-insecure-hosts~ to allow users to connect to
  insecure forges.  #9

- Support Github instances that use an undocumented url-schema, which
  users report to have sighted in the wild.

- ~ghub-fetch-repository~ now also fetches ~reviewRequests~.

- Various bug fixes and improvements.

* v3.2.0    2018-12-27

- Work around bug in Emacs versions before 26.1 that prevented newly
  created tokens from being used without the user invalidating
  ~auth-source~'s cache first.

- Teach ~glab-repository-id~ about subgroups.

* v3.1.0    2018-12-20

- Support GraphQL aliases.

- Show number of GraphQL page currently being fetched in mode-line.

- Add a default errorback for asynchronous REST requests, which shows
  the same information as would be shown for a failed synchronous
  request.

- Signal an error if ~ghub-repository-id~ fails.

- ~ghub-fetch-repository~ fetches a few more fields.

* v3.0.0    2018-10-31

- Add support for Gitea, Gogs and Bitbucket.  ~ghub.el~ supports these
  forges directly, but also add new libraries ~gtea.el~, ~gogs.el~ and
  ~buck.el~, which provide convenience wrappers just like the existing
  ~glab.el~.  [[https://github.com/tarsius/ghub/issues/67][#67]]

- No longer split the repository into multiple Melpa packages.
  I.e. the ~glab.el~ library is now part of the ~ghub~ package.

- Add support for automatic GraphQL unpagination.  [[https://github.com/tarsius/ghub/issues/68][#68]]

  GraphQL was designed around the idea that you should be able to "ask
  for what you need and get exactly that".  Unfortunately this does not
  cover the "look, if I persist, then you are going to hand me over all
  the data anyway, so just cough it up already", which is what Forge
  needs.

  ~ghub--graphql-vacuum~ provides a way to unpaginate all cursors in the
  returned data without having to write a lot of boilerplate.  Callers
  have to provide the query as an s-expression that corresponds to the
  root request.  The queries needed to follow cursors in arbitrary
  locations within the returned data, are automatically derived from
  that query.

  ~ghub-fetch-repository~ fetches information about a repository.
  If also serves as an example for how to use ~ghub--graphql-vacuum~.

  The initial queries used by ~ghub-fetch-issue~ and
  ~ghub-fetch-pullreq~ are pre-narrowed variants of the initial query of
  ~ghub-fetch-repository~.  Pre-narrowing is somewhat similar to the use
  of fragments, but unlike that, it doesn't result in lots of duplicated
  boilerplate and/or lots of variables.

  There is very little documentation and everything is still very much
  subject to change.

- Bind ~url-show-message~ to ~nil~ so that the more useful messages
  displayed by the callers of this package are visible to the user
  instead of the less useful "Contacting host: api.github.com:443".

- Sometimes Github returns an HTML document instead of the promised
  JSON when an error occurs.  Try harder to extract some meaningful
  information from that document.

- Work around a bug in older Emacsen that prevented ~auth-source~ from
  retrieving saved secrets.  [[https://github.com/tarsius/ghub/issues/64][#64]]

- Deal with a chicken and egg problem concerning 2fa.  [[https://github.com/tarsius/ghub/issues/65][#65]]

- Add new ~ghub-clear-caches~ command because if things go wonky it is
  nice to know it isn't the cache.

- Add new ~ghub-repository-id~ function.  This function works for all
  supported forges and always returns a string, even for less
  successful forges that can still get away with using integers as ids.

- Add new ~ghub-graphql-rate-limit~ function.
