;;; Commentary:

;; Ghub is a library that provides basic support for using the Github API
;; from Emacs packages.  It abstracts access to API resources using only
;; a handful of functions that are not resource-specific.

;; It also handles the creation, storage and use of access tokens using a
;; setup wizard, to make it easier for users to get started and to reduce
;; the support burden imposed on package maintainers.  It also comes with
;; a comprehensive manual to address the cases when things don't just
;; work as expected.

;; Ghub is intentionally limited to only provide these two essential
;; features — basic request functions and guided setup — to avoid being
;; too opinionated, which would hinder wide adaption.  It is assumed that
;; wide adoption would make life easier for users and maintainers alike,
;; because then all packages that talk to the Github API could be
;; configured the same way.

  "The Github API scopes that your private tools need.

The token that is created based on the value of this variable
is used when `ghub-request' (or one of its wrappers) is called
without providing a value for AUTH.  Packages should always
identify themselves using that argument, but when you use Ghub
directly in private tools, then that is not necessary and the
request is made on behalf of the `ghub' package itself, aka on
behalf of some private tool.

By default the only requested scope is `repo' because that is
sufficient as well as required for most common uses.  This and
other scopes are documented at https://magit.vc/goto/2e586d36.

If your private tools need other scopes, then you have to add
them here *before* creating the token.  Alternatively you can
edit the scopes of an existing token using the web interface
at https://github.com/settings/tokens.")

  "Make a request for RESOURCE and return the response body.

Also place the response header in `ghub-response-headers'.

METHOD is the http method, given as a string.
RESOURCE is the resource to access, given as a string beginning
  with a slash.

PARAMS, QUERY, PAYLOAD and HEADERS are alists used to specify
  data.  The Github API documentation is vague on how data has
  to be transmitted and for a particular resource usually just
  talks about \"parameters\".  Generally speaking when the METHOD
  is \"HEAD\" or \"GET\", then they have to be transmitted as a
  query, otherwise as a payload.
Use PARAMS to automatically transmit like QUERY or PAYLOAD would
  depending on METHOD.
Use QUERY to explicitly transmit data as a query.
Use PAYLOAD to explicitly transmit data as a payload.
Use HEADERS for those rare resources that require that the data
  is transmitted as headers instead of as a query or payload.
  When that is the case, then the api documentation usually
  mentions it explicitly.

If UNPAGINATE is non-nil, then make multiple requests if necessary
  to get all items at RESOURCE.
If NOERROR is non-nil, then do not raise an error if the request
  fails and return nil instead.
If READER is non-nil, then it is used to read and return from the
  response buffer.  The default is `ghub--read-json-response'.
  For the very few resources that do not return json, you might
  want to use `ghub--read-raw-response'.

If USERNAME is non-nil, then make a request on behalf of that
  user.  It is better to specify the user using the Git variable
  `github.user' for \"api.github.com\", or `github.HOST.user' if
  connecting to a Github Enterprise instance.

Each package that uses `ghub' should use its own token. If AUTH
  is nil, then the generic `ghub' token is used instead.  This
  is only acceptable for personal utilities.  A packages that
  is distributed to other users should always use this argument
  to identify itself, using a symbol matching its name.

  Package authors who find this inconvenient should write a
  wrapper around this function and possibly for the method
  specific functions also.

  Some symbols have a special meaning.  `none' means to make an
  unauthorized request.  `basic' means to make a password based
  request.  If the value is a string, then it is assumed to be
  a valid token.  `basic' and an explicit token string are only
  intended for internal and debugging uses.

  If AUTH is a package symbol, then the scopes are specified
  using the variable `AUTH-github-token-scopes'.  It is an error
  if that is not specified.  See `ghub-github-token-scopes' for
  an example.

If HOST is non-nil, then connect to that Github instance.  This
  defaults to \"api.github.com\".  When a repository is connected
  to a Github Enterprise instance, then it is better to specify
  that using the Git variable `github.host' instead of using this
  argument."
